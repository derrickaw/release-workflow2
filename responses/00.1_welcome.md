## Welcome!

Hello and welcome! In this course you will learn how to build release based workflows on GitHub.  You'll learn when and how to create a release, and how to facilitate large releases with branching. To do this, we'll be playing around with the code in this repository.

### New to GitHub?

For this course, you'll need some background knowledge. If you need a refresher on the GitHub flow, check out [the Introduction to GitHub course]({{ host}}/courses/introduction-to-github).

## Step 1: Create a release

Before we start practicing a workflow for larger releases, let's create a release right now. You can create a release at any time, and from any commit or branch.

### :keyboard: Activity: Create a release for the current codebase


1. Go to the [**Releases** page]({{ releases }}) for this repository.
  - You can click the link above, or click the **Code** tab at the top of your repository. Then, find the navigation bar below the repository description, and click **0 releases**.
1. Click **Create a new release**.
1. In the field for _Tag version_, specify a number. In this case, use use **v0.9**. Keep the _Target_ as **master**.
1. Give the release a title, like "First beta release". If you'd like, you could also give the release a short description.
1. Select the checkbox next to **This is a pre-release**, since it is representing a beta version.
