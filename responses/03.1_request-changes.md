## Branching workflows for releases

With the GitHub Flow, we always branch from and to `master`. But, with many changes necessary for one release, we may want to keep our pull requests small. We can do this by creating a **release branch**. By creating new branches from the release branch, and merging them back into the release branch, we can keep our changes in a sandbox environment but still make sure to see and test them all together.

## Step 4

Right now, this pull request has a `base` of `master`. We'll want to merge it into a release branch. First, create a release branch named v1.0 based off of master.

### :keyboard: Activity:

1. In the branch dropdown, make sure the branch `master` is currently selected.
1. Click the `master` dropdown, and create a new branch named `v1.0`.
